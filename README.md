## java beans

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOvak6awDrI

I want to take about another level of javaBean discussion . Based on kind of data they hold , we see java bean in three forms here, 

 1. Type of java Beans

 * VO class (value Object class)
 * DTO class ( data transfer Object class)
 * BO class ( Business Object class)

 2. Vo class are the java bean that holds input values of the application  are output values to be displayed from from the application . Input values are like something like form data . If you want to store any object that in a single object you may think about going . You ready to meet work is take the data and display it . that time we can take the support of the VO class 

3. 

 DTO is a java bean that implements `Serializable` interface having capability to hold our data to send from one component to another component ï¼Œ generally controller component to service component that  we will travel in the form of DTO and reverse also happened in the form of DTO 

4. BO class : 
> it is also called Domain class , Entity class , Persistence class

the java bean whose object holds data given by persistence logic execution , that hold values that can be inserted into the database table call be called as VO ;

the key is these properties and database table column must be compatible with each other , that's for a rule for sure ;

So generally in persistence logic development , inputs required for persistence logic , output generated by persistence logic will be maintained in the form of BO class objects 

generally when selector query is execute in the persistence logic, 

```bash
student_info
--------------
|-> stno(n)(pk)
|-> stname (vc2)
|-> stavg(n)

public class StudentBO {
    private int stno;
    private string sname;
    private float stavg;
    // setter and getters
}


```

// the video is perfect  , we should watch it more times

the VO is the controller get (in) from table, and render (out) as a model in the jsp; so it should be compatible with the front end;

the the controller convert it to DTO and sent it to the service (same as the ) ;

the service convert the DTO to the BO and send it to the DAO;

the DAO insert the data to the database;
